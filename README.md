# Cordova-Camera-App
This is a Cordova Camera App that allows the user to take pictures and display them on their mobile device. They can also view a photo from the devices photo library.  

### Sources
To build this app I used the Cordova Camera Plugin which allows you to interact with the mobile devices camera. With this I also used code snippets from the Cordova Camera Plugin GitHub repository. The documentation and code can be found [here](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-camera).
